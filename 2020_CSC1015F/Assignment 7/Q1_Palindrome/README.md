A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of symbols or elements, whose meaning 
may be interpreted the same way in either forward or reverse direction (see Wikipedia).

Write a Python program called ‘palindrome.py’ that uses a recursive function to calculate 
whether or not a string is a palindrome (reads the same if reversed). 

You may NOT use iteration, or a string slice expression (or any other technique) to reverse the string 
without using recursion!

Sample I/O:

```
Enter a string:
able was I ere I saw elba
```
Palindrome!

Sample I/O:
Enter a string:
```
elba is a noob
```
Not a palindrome!
